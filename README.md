# Enhancing-HIV-Preventive-Medication
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells, which are crucial for fighting infections. If untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS, making the body vulnerable to infections. HIV/AIDS has a significant impact on global public health, social structures, and economies, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and leading to millions of deaths worldwide.
The DP pill, a form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), when taken daily, reduces the risk of HIV infection in high-risk individuals. Adhering to the DP regimen is essential for maximizing its protective benefits and achieving public health goals.

# DP Pills Distributions
The initial distribution of DP pills is successful, but the adherence rates drop significantly after the first month.
A significant drop-off in continuation rates is observed from the first to the second month.
A consistent 20% adherence rate is observed from the second to the third month, indicating a need for intervention to improve long-term adherence.
# Recommended Interventions
Daily Reminders: Send daily SMS or app notifications to patients reminding them to take their DP pills. These reminders can include motivational messages and tips on the importance of adherence.
Monthly Reminders: Send monthly reminders for clinic visits to refill DP prescriptions. These reminders can be personalized based on the patientâ€™s initial visit date and include information on the nearest clinic location.
Educational Content: Include educational content in the reminders to address any misconceptions or stigma associated with HIV prevention and the use of DP pills.
# Conclusion

The analysis revealed significant behavioral challenges affecting patient adherence to the DP regimen. By implementing a reminder system, we aimed to address these issues and improve adherence rates. The data-driven intervention showed promising results, with an increase in DP usage and continuous refilling rates. Continued evaluation and targeted strategies are essential for enhancing the program's effectiveness and achieving public health goals.
